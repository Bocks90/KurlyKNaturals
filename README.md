# About Kurly K Naturals 

Kurly K Naturals is a business website I created for my MS1 project with Code Institute.

The goal of Kurly K Naturals is to  help people to maintain and grow strong, healthy hair using organic natural products. The majority of people within the Afro-Carribean community have found it difficult to take care of their hair and will often end up using products that can damage their hair in the long run. This can lead to depression, losing confidence as we all want to look and feel as good as possible. Kurly K offers a range of coaching services which allows them to focus solely on their clients and to tailor a hair regime that is best suited for their hair. They also offer group classes to those that don't want to do a one on one. This is great for clients as it allows them a platform to network and to socialise. The final coaching service is our online video tutorials on Youtube as they are passionate about helping others. We felt that it would be great to offer free content to everyone to help raise awareness on healthy hair. Finally Kurly K also offers complimentary Homemade natural products to their clients to compliment their hair regime programs.

The purpose for the website is to give the users more information about the products and services we offer at Kurly K Naturals. It will also allow us to showcase our results and the testimonials from previous clients. It will be important for Kurly K to have a contact form to enable people to get in touch. Whilst we want to also have links to social media to increase the footfall on these platforms. As the business grows there will be potential to expand this website in the future.
