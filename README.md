# About 

Kurly K Naturals is a business website I created for my MS1 project with Code Institute.

The goal of Kurly K Naturals is to  help people to maintain and grow strong, healthy hair using organic natural products. The majority of people within the Afro-Carribean community have found it difficult to take care of their hair and will often end up using products that can damage their hair in the long run. This can lead to depression, losing confidence as we all want to look and feel as good as possible. Kurly K offers a range of coaching services which allows them to focus solely on their clients and to tailor a hair regime that is best suited for their hair. They also offer group classes to those that don't want to do a one on one. This is great for clients as it allows them a platform to network and to socialise. The final coaching service is our online video tutorials on Youtube as they are passionate about helping others. We felt that it would be great to offer free content to everyone to help raise awareness on healthy hair. Finally Kurly K also offers complimentary Homemade natural products to their clients to compliment their hair regime programs.

The purpose for the website is to give the users more information about the products and services we offer at Kurly K Naturals. It will also allow us to showcase our results and the testimonials from previous clients. It will be important for Kurly K to have a contact form to enable people to get in touch. Whilst we want to also have links to social media to increase the footfall on these platforms. As the business grows there will be potential to expand this website in the future.

# Designs
# Surface
## Colour 

I decided to use Dark Brown as my main colour theme for the website. After Using Contrast checker I decided to pair this with an off-white colour for contrast. This will boost the accessibility for visually impaired users. This goes with the theme of the website and the business. I also included black and a medium shade of brown to add a bit of diversity to the color scheme whilst keeping it stylish.

These colours feature several times throughout the website which is why I have set a variable roots in the code to make it easier for myself to stay on track..

I have used the following colors:

![Root Colors](readmefiles/rootcolors.png) 

The best thing about using the variable method is that if a change in color or theme needs to occur i can do this by simply changing a root color. The only other Color i used was Gold which was used as a hover feature for my buttons in the header section.
 
I used [Web Fx](https://www.webfx.com/web-design/color-picker/) to help me identify the main color that I wanted to use. Initially i decided to go with a bronze/brown theme. One this was decided I then used [WebAim](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to identify suitable matching colors by contrast for my main color to ensure the website provided quality visibility.

## Typography

I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for my fonts. I chose Cororande Grande  as my main font throughout the website and used sans-serif as my back up font. This is a unique style that is easy to read and looks very stylish at a range of sizes. I believe that the slick look suits the nature of the business which makes it a great match..

I used different font weights for the headers and adjusted the size to make it visually clear for the user.

## Nav links

* I made the Nav links as easy and simple to use to increase the accessibility across the website.
* The button links highlight a different color when you hover the mouse over to help make it obvious that it's a link.
* The submit button on the contact form was styled to make the form look even better.
* The “Contact us"  button in the main body of the Homepage  takes them directly to the form.
* The social media links in the footer will send the user to the company's social media pages. 

## Imagery 

This was one of the most important aspects for the business, the reason is that this business is in the Hair and Beauty sector and a lot of the decisions will be made visually. I focused on gathering images that were bold and catchy on the eye. The hero image on the homepage and offers page had to represent the nature of the business. I wanted it to show beauty and family between a mother and a child.

I also included some original photos from the actual business. These images are  progress images that show off the actual service and the achievements of Hair growth. I also used pictures of the products that are homemade and packaged where I then took the pictures and uploaded this onto the website. I felt that this offers more originality and wants to give a clearer insight into the business.

I used a gold pattern background-image for the "Contact us" page. I felt like the gold-background represents a positive and exciting theme and putting this in the contact page was best suited for this.

 # Skeleton

 ## Layout
* I used responsive design to build the website. This is to avoid having any issues when the website is being viewed on different screen sizes, where you will be able to view more content on a larger screen whilst on a smaller screen the content adjusts to be viewed in a suitable manner.
* Media queries were used to ensure that the content looked good on different screen sizes.
* I used Bootstrap 4 to help build grids and my Carousel testimonial.
* I also used CSS to style the layout to ensure that the paddings, margins and positioning of my layouts looked good.

# Features
## Features Across the Site

### Header
The Navigation bar can be found  on the Header Section on every page. The links have the hover feature which turns the writing Gold when you hover your mouse over the text. They will navigate you to the page you select. I also included a Logo image link which sits on the left side of the header. This link simply redirects you to the homepage. The header needed to be responsive so I used Bootstrap  4 to build the grid and added the class “navbar-expand-sm” to enable the nav bar to collapse on a smaller screen to improve usability. The main color brown has been applied to the background of the header.
### Footer
The footer was built in 3 separate sections which are “Contact details”, “Social Media” and “logo”. I used bootstrap to arrange the layout so that the three sections will stack on top of each other when using a smaller device. The contact details simply has our Telephone and Email address to contact the business on. The Social Media section has direct links to the social media platforms (Facebook, Instagram and Youtube). Once you click on the icons it will navigate you straight to the social media pages. The icons are the logo which was taken from Font Awesome. They have a hover feature that changes color when you hover the cursor over it. The footer uses the main brown theme as a background with off-white text.
### Responsiveness
The website has been built to be responsive for all devices. To do this i used the media query technique in CSS to adjust the service section to make it responsive with smaller devices. I also used Bootstrap with some of the grids too.
### Accessibility
Links are consistent and they all work fine. I have set a suitable contrast to match the background in each section to make the site viewable to a range of readers. Social media links work. I have included alt and aria-label attributes to all of my images and nav links to make the site easier for visual impairments. Whilst font has been set to rem so that the font size increases automatically for somebody using large font settings.
### Meta data
* I have included Meta data to boost SEO results and have given every page on the website its own title so that you can notice what page your on form looking at the tab.
### Homepage Features
* The Hero Image has a Cover box over it which says the Company name (Kurly K Naturals) with the slogan "Teaching Others How To Grow Long and Healthy Hair". The box has a lower opacity to make it visually smoother. 
* The Offer section has a paragraph that talks about what the business offers. It also has two images one represents the products and the other services. When viewed on a smaller screen the images stack on top of each other.
* The Benefits section has an ordered list with bullet points that states the benefits of the business.
* The homepage has two extra links in the body "Products & Services" redirects you to offers page and "Get in Touch" will redirect you to the contact page. 
* The Testimonial is a  carousel styled layout that slides from one testimonial to the other. This was built using Bootstrap where I then changed the color to suit the theme of the website.
### Offers Features
* The Hero Image has the same features as the homepage image. The only difference was the image used.
* The Service section has two paragraphs aligned side by side with each other that explain the services we offer. The paragraphs fall on top of each other when viewed on smaller screens. This section also has two images side by side that respond the same as the text. Below this is a contact us button that directs you to the Contact us page.
* The Products section consists of 3 divs placed side by side with another. Inside each div you have a header with the products name with the image below, followed be a description of the product. On smaller devices the div sections fall on top of each other.
### Contact Features
* The form was built to appear differently depending on the screen sizes to improve the visual appearance. ( This can be seen in the Contact us section)
* The form has a field to enter your Name using text which was done using the input=’”text”
* The email section has been set to accept email addresses only within this box.
* The number section also requires a number before you are able to submit.
* The Radio button feature is used to select the contact type. This was used as i felt this is a suitable method to get the information required form the user.
* The Text Area is there to allow the user to give me additional information on their reasons for getting in contact.
* The Submit Button included at the bottom of the form.
### Future Features
* Once the business grows there will be a need to include a shopping basket with a checkout section to allow the business to process orders on the website.
* Allow customers to create user accounts and have their own profile which they can use to track their progress and speak with other customers on their journey.
* Add tutorial videos to the website to allow users to view some content whilst browsing our website.
* A map with the business location on the contact us page.

![initital Lighthouse test(homepage)](readmefiles/homepagelighthouse.png) 
![initital Lighthouse test(offers)](readmefiles/offerslighthouse.png)
![initital Lighthouse test(contact)](readmefiles/contactlighthouse.png)

Accessibility was a big issue that I had with my performance results. To boost this I added aria-labels to all of my links. To boost my performance results I compressed my image sizes to increase the load time. Whilst adding metadata to improve my SEO score which gave me the results below.

# Bugs
The scroller in my Carousel for Testimonials wasn’t working. When i would click on it a 404 error message would appear in a separate tab. I realised that there was a typos with my id. Once i changed the coding the scroller worked perfectly fine.

I had an issue with my products section where I was unable to center the text using the text-align element on CSS. I realised the issue was that I built the section using bootstrap which had an impact on my css code. I used the Text-center attribute in HTML for images which fixed the issue.

I received a 404 error message once I deployed my  website. This stopped my images from showing on my website when it was deployed for some of my images. I realised that the issue was that i put ../ on the file path which isn't being picked up by the browser. One i changed the relative file path to  assets/images/coaching1.jpg and used this method for the other broken pictures this fixed the issue.

[404 error message](https://github.com/Bocks90/KurlyKNaturals/blob/master/readmefiles/404error.png)

An error occurred because i had nested an element within a button element which showed as an error when i attempted to do my HTML validator..  This was a mistake that was easy to fix once i understood that this rule couldn't happen. I removed the button element and changed the CSS to affect the (a) element to keep the link stylish . Once i changed this my HTML validator passed the test.

[HTML VALIDATOR](https://github.com/Bocks90/KurlyKNaturals/blob/master/readmefiles/htmlerror.png)

In the Products section which was built using Bootstrap, I was having issues centering the third div on a medium screen device. To fix the issue i changed the code div to occupy the full column on a medium screen.
